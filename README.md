# Blog-topic
I am planning on creating a land consulting blog where I will discuss weekly tips on how farmers, hunters, and the average land owner can improve the quality of their land in the midwest while keeping their property goals in mind. Each blog will discus good management practices that the average person can easily understand and utilize for this time of the year. People are always curious as to what they can do throughout the year to improve their land. This blog will provide the reader with management practices that they can implement this fall and winter.
 
 
 ## Blog outline
 - Blog 1 will be about TSI (timber stand improvement). I will discuss how to select desired tree species to develop healthier timber stands for the average land owner whether that be 1 acre of timber or 500 acres of timber.
- Blog 2 will be about creating more available forage for wild game species on your property. I will talk about several ways to increase the amount of available forage. ex: food plots, planting certain trees that provide nutrition (Oaks, persimmons, fruit trees, etc.)
- Blog 3 will be about utilizing hunting methods as a way to supress the exponential population growth of of whitetail deer on your property this fall. I will discuss how high numbers of various wildlife species can have a neggative impact on the health of your property.
